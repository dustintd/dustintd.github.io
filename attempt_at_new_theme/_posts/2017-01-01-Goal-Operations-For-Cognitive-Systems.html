<p><b>Abstract:</b> Cognitive agents operating in complex and dynamic domains
    benefit from significant goal management. Operations on
    goals include formulation, selection, change, monitoring and
    delegation in addition to goal achievement. Here we model
    these operations as transformations on goals. An agent may
    observe events that affect the agentâ€™s ability to achieve its
    goals. Hence goal transformations allow unachievable goals to
    be converted into similar achievable goals. This paper examines an implementation of goal change within a cognitive
    architecture. We introduce goal transformation at the metacognitive level as well as goal transformation in an
    automated
    planner and discuss the costs and benefits of each approach.
    We evaluate goal change in the MIDCA architecture using a
    resource-restricted planning domain, demonstrating a performance benefit due to goal operations.</p>
