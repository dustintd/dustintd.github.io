<p><b>Abstract:</b>IBM’s Watson uses a variety of scoring algorithms to rank
    candidate answers for natural language questions. These scoring algorithms played a crucial role in Watson’s win
    against human champions
    in Jeopardy!. We show that this same technique can be implemented
    within a real-time strategy (RTS) game playing goal-driven autonomy
    (GDA) agent. Previous GDA agents in RTS games were forced to use
    very compact state representations. Watson’s scoring algorithms technique removes this restriction for goal
    selection, allowing the use of all
    information available in the game state. Unfortunately, there is a high
    knowledge engineering effort required to create new scoring algorithms.
    We alleviate this burden using case-based reasoning to approximate past
    observations of a scoring algorithm system. Our experiments in a realtime strategy game show that goal selection by
    the CBR system attains
    comparable in-game performance to a baseline scoring algorithm system.</p>
