title: About Me
---

<p>I am a computer scientist focusing on artificial intelligence (A.I.) systems. I received my Bachelor's of Science from
    Indiana University, Bloomington in 2012 and my PhD from Lehigh University in 2017. My research interests span a wide range
    of A.I. including automated planning and acting, goal reasoning, cognitive architectures, machine learning,
    knowledge-based systems, explanation (both internal and external), and introspective agents. </p>
